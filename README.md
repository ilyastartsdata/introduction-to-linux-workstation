## Installing / Getting started

In order to get started, we need the following tools:
  
  1. Ready virtual machine with the following parameters: CPU - 1 Gb, RAM - 2 Gb, hard disk - at least 10 Gb
  2. Downloaded version of the latest Ubuntu Server LTS image
  
Connect the image to the virtual machine as shown in the instructions and launch it.

After the start we will see the first difference between the server version of Ubuntu and the desktop version - the lack of a graphical interface for the installer. The control is simple: Up, Down, Left, Right keys - move through the menu, Space key - select the item, Enter applies the selected item.
