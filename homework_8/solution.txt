Homework #8

Task 1

The first step was to update the system via the following two commands:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade

The necessary packages were then installed via sudo apt-get install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common

Docker repositories have been added by way:

  curl -fsSL https://download.docker .com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo add-apt-repository â€œdeb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu$(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  
I then updated the repository information via sudo apt update

  sudo apt install docker-ce
