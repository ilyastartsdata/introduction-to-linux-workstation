Problem with the tilde sign

I spent more than one hour making a tilde sign in the terminal on a mac, but I failed. The layout of my keyboard is QWERT.
I had planned to enter: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

Next steps:
1. Open file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2. Comment on the PasswordAuthentication directive and establish meaning no - PasswordAuthentication no
3. Save changes, restart via sudo systemctl restart ssh. Then we go back to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
4. PasswordAuthentication yes
5. Sudo systemctl reload sshd

The difference between restart and reload is that restart means full stop and start after it, while reload continues to work and simply re-reads the configuration files.

Create a file via cat > file_name, write to it and use the Contol + D keys. Exit from the file is performed. 

I assume that this is EOF (end of file), i.e. the input stream is finished.

Installation mc via sudo apt-get install mc
