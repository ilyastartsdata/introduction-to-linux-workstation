Homework #6

Task 1

Creating the text file
cat file.txt

Script to perform two tasks
#!/bin/bash
sed '/s^$/d' file.txt >> output.txt
sed -e 's/\(.*\)/\U\1/' file.txt >> output.txt

Running the script and checking the results
sudo chmod +x removeandupper.sh
./removeandupper.sh
cat output.txt

The idea that came the next morning was to unite the two sed teams via a vertical line |

Task 2

Unfortunately, I was so passionate about the task that I did not take screenshots of the process itself

Script used: for i in {2010...2017}; do for j in {1...12}; do for f in {1...10}; do mkdir -p year_$i/month_$j & echo "file_$f" >> year_$i/month_$j/$f.txt; done; done; done

Task 4

Used grep -r 'ivolgini' /var/log/syslog once to view system events occurring with ivolgini

Second time used grep -r 'INFO' /var/log/syslog to search for matches by string (as in the lesson)

Task 5

First I did with the shutdown command, then I thought and remembered that we need to reboot, not knock them out.
I rebooted it 6 or 7 times, because if shutdown is ready to be scheduled, reboot does it immediately even though the syntax is the same.
My version is: echo "reboot" | at 0000 aug 20
