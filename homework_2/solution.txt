The archive from the screenshots is too heavy, so I designed it like this.

Checking the status of the directory using ```ls```.

Deletion of existing directories and files using ```rm and ```rm -r```.

Creation of new testfolder and productionfolder directories using ```mkdir```.

Switching to testfolder using cd and creating a file using ```touch```.

Switching to the reverse directory using ```cd`` and creating a file there.

Switching between directories using the absolute path.

Error when trying to write to a file inside a testfolder.

Tried to write into a log file and displayed its contents using the ```cat```.

Renaming the file using ```mv``` and copying the file to the same directory but with a new name.

Copying a file from one directory to another using ```sudo su``` administrative rights and copying ```cp```.
